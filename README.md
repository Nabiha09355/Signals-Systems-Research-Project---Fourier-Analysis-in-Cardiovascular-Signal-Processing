# Fourier Analysis in Cardiovascular Signal Processing
For this project, we analyzed cardiovascular signals using Direct Fourier Series and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) methods to enhance ECG signal quality. Developed a MATLAB-based pipeline for noise reduction, data compression, and the detection of cardiac disorders like ventricular fibrillation
